description: "A numerical value which adjusts the parameters of a model. How much it adjusts is controlled by the [learning rate](learning_rate.qmd)."

The gradients update the parameters by multiplying the two together. How much the gradients update the parameters is controlled by the [learning rate](learning_rate.qmd).

A positive gradient tells us that increasing the parameters will increase the [loss](loss.qmd). On the other hand, decreasing the parameters will decrease the [loss](loss.qmd).

A negative gradient tells us that decreasing the parameters will increase the [loss](loss.qmd) On the other hand, increasing the parameters will decrease the [loss](loss.qmd).
